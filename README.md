### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is JoÃ£o Victor Ahmad, and I'm a Brazilian Computer Engineering Student who not too long ago became obsessed with programming. I try to learn as much as I can everyday and I'm always striving to reach the next level through every new challenge.
-Most of the repositories on my profile,especially the older ones, are here to keep track of my learning path and for the purpose of self-evaluation so most don't have elaborate documentation.
-I'm currently learning Web Development and I'm looking for oportunities to earn experience with real world projects.
-Also I love Video-games,animes,science fiction,martial-arts and Rock'n Roll \,,/
