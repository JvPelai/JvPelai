### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is JoÃ£o, and I'm a Brazilian Software Developer, eager to overcome bigger challenges, learn new technologies and frameworks, and build next generation solutions. I keep many repos here as reference material for myself but if you find anything interesting, feel free to reach out to me. I'm enthusiastic about NodeJS, Docker and Kubernetes and my current focus is on acquiring knowledge and skills to build microservices ready for production!
